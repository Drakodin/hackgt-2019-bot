This bot user was created using DV8FromTheWorld's Java Discord API (JDA), Version 3.8.3

Source code is not yet available and it is not yet public for public guild use.

This bot was developed for the HackGT 2019 Competition (Note the images associated) with the intent of entertainment.
However, it contains functionality that can be extended for other uses such as sparking creativity born from creativity itself.

The source code of this bot user is written in Java. The JDA 3.8.3 was used as an external reference dependency.
It uses WebSocket to communicate with Discord's hosting server and acts to take inputs from Users (Clients) and instruct
the server to take specific actions using User input.

Since bot functionality is specifically defined, this bot can be translated using appropriate APIs to other languages
such as Python, C++, or JavaScript. In this case, Java was preferred due to developer experience (primarily my own)
